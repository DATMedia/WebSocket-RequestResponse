# WebSocket-RequestResponse

Implements Request-Response using web sockets and the Eneter Framework. 

This is following the blog here: http://eneter.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/html5-request-response-communication.html

The differences are:
 - I'm using a WPF application as the Server
 - I'm using a Google Chrome application as the client

To build and run this, you will need to download the eneter library, as outlined in the blog entry
